## GENERAL INFORMATION:

The ModComponent SDK is a Unity Tool designed to completely overhaul the current process of creating `.modcomponent` items for The Long Dark.

This repository going forward, will have all and any documentation / information regarding ModComponent and ModComponent SDK. This information ranges from tutorials to a comprehensive list of each Component, Behaviour and Blueprint.

The old ways of creating `.modcomponent`'s was clunky and often time consuming with guessing what has gone wrong. This tool eliminates that issue and allows you to focus more on creating the items you want while having an easy learning curb.

### Features:
- **Simplified GEAR Creation**: Streamlines the creation process for ModComponents, making it much more accessible for beginners.
- **Data Assets System**: Different assets types are used for certain fields. Helps prevent searching up for Scenes, Sounds, etc all manually.
- **Inspect Previewer**: _Currently In Development_
- **Mod Manager**: Comes with a built-in Mod Manager to manage multiple ModComponent mods seamlessly.
- **Example Mod**: Also comes with an optional Example Mod package to preview how items are made with the ModComponent SDK.
- **GEAR Prefab Validator**: Select your custom GEAR Prefab to run it through a series of checks. This makes sure nothing will cause errors.
- **Auto Updater**: Automatically check for updates within Unity for the ModComponent SDK and Example Mod. Automatically downloads and installs them as well.
- **User Friendly**: Easy to understand User Interface for navigating through different assets and components. With built-in tooltips for clarity.
- **Supports Everything**: From Components, Behaviours, Blueprints, Recipes, Localizations, Gear Spawns and more - it supports everything.
